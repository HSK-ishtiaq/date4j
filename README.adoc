= date4j

== What?

This is Ian Darwin's REPACKAGING of Hirondelle Systems's Date4J API.

I think of *date4j* as "the small, simple, *sensible* Date API for Java."

Read all about it on http://date4j.net/

Of course, today one might just as well use +java.time.*+ instead.

== Mavenizing Date4J

The code's author is not a fan of Maven, but since he has thoughtfully put it under the BSD license, this is my "Redistribution and use in source and binary forms" with an intent to make it
available to all Maven/Gradle/Buildr/etc Nexus/MavenCentral users.

I have made no code changes, and plan to make none.

I have reorganized the code into standard Maven directory structure, added the POM file, removed the lib directory (uses a Maven depends).
and have set it up for inclusion in Maven Centrals, as I've done for one of my own projects.
